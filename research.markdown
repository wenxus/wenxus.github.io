# AI Safety Research

I'm actively conducting research on AI safety and alignment, focusing on making AI systems more transparent and controllable.

## Current & Recent Projects

### Vulnerability in Trusted Monitoring and Mitigations
Research conducted as part of AI Safety Camp, exploring vulnerabilities in AI monitoring systems and developing robust mitigation strategies.

### SAE-driven Auto Steering
Independent research on using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for automated steering of language model behaviors, contributing to interpretability and control mechanisms.

### Efficient Sparse Autoencoder Feature Splitting
Research on improving the efficiency of sparse autoencoder feature splitting methods, aimed at better understanding and decomposing neural network representations.

## Current Focus

I'm currently part of the ML Alignment and Theory Scholars (MATS) program, conducting AI Control research on Chain-of-Thought monitorability with David Lindner, Scott Emmons, and Erik Jenner.
