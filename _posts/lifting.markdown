I never thought I'd fall in love with powerlifing, but here we are. It all started earlier this year when I was going through training for community emergency response. We had to do a two-person drill where we carried a "patient." One of my classmates was a retired nurse, a lovely lady. She sized me up for a second, then calmly suggested, "I think I might be stronger than you, so why don’t I carry them?" Her tone was so matter-of-fact and friendly, but it still hit me with a tinge of embarrassment.

That, and the fact that I'd heard people rave about strength training during climbing sessions, finally got me to commit to it at the start of the year. Little did I know, our little town is secretly home to several world record-holding powerlifters and top-notch coaches. I got lucky enough to meet them, and thus began my weightlifting journey.

Fast forward a few months, and now I can move heavy furniture without asking people for help, which, honestly, makes me feel pretty badass. My climbing has also improved, though I've gained some weight. Yet, every now and then, while flitting between rocks, I actually feel... light and nimble. The best surprise? Hiking downhill feels way better than before. Turns out, using muscles to brake is much nicer than relying on your knees. I have way more control over each step now. My legs and glutes aren’t the only ones getting stronger—my abs and upper body have also gotten a boost, and my balance is way better.

But honestly, the biggest win hasn’t been the strength itself. It’s the changes in my daily habits, learning about how the my body works, mastering the rhythm of tension and relaxation, and improving my sleep and diet. Even more importantly, lifting is building my mental strength and resilience, not to mention how awesome it is to be in a team of absolute badass women.

The first I want to go into details is lifting is chaning my lifestyle and training my mind. Coach J said this very early on, when I was still on the fence about lifting, that powerlifting is a lifestyle. But I finally start to understand a little bit. 

Powerlifting requires engaging many different muscle all at once. Lifting cues and right form helps with that. 

Initially I was just really tired.
